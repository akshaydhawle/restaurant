# including js code in ts projects

- js code

```js
file: tax.js
export function calculateTax(income){
return income * .3;
}

file : index.ts
import { calculateTax } from './tax'; //compilation error because js is not added in tsconfig by default

let tax = calculateTax(100);
console.log(tax);
```

- tsconfig 
- we have to turn on 
- allowjs: true property

- after running code we get the error:
- **cannot use import statement outside a module**

- this is happen because we use module to es2015 in last time.

- changed below setting
tsconfig.json 
module: CommonJs

- now it's working

# type checking js code

```js
let tax = calculateTax();
```

- if we run this code in js we'll get error in runtime not in compiletime , so in order to solve this issue 

- tsconfig 
checkjs: true - get some basic type checking

- once run we get error with tsc

- temporarily disable checking js code 
- add below line in top of the file
```js
// @ts-nocheck
```

# how to check for types in js

- generate jsdocs on function

```js
/**
 * @param {number} income - net salary
  * @returns {number}
*/
export function calculateTax(income){
return income * .3;
}
```

- recompile code we'll get error

```ts
let tax = calculateTax(10_000);
```

- with jsdocs we can describe out function , give ts some information for validation


# creating declaration files / type definition file

- we've another way to provide information to ts

- name of the declaration file should be same as the corresponding js file.
- in this file we can declare all the features of the target module.
- using d file we can provide type info to ts

```ts
file: tax.d.ts
declare function calculateTax(income: number): number;

file: tax.js - target module
export function calculateTax(income){
return income * .3;
}
```

- imp - we should describe all the features of target so it is visible to compiler


# using definitely typed declaration files

- npm i lodash

```ts
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```

- we get error , can't find module lodash
since it is pure js lib 

- so search google - DefinitelyTyped  github
- this is where we find declaration files for all popular js lib

- in order to install this definitely type
> npm i  -D  @types/lodash

- error gone

- we don't need to every time install definitely typed,
because most of code today supports declaration file.

> npm i chalk

- in node_modules/chalk we can see - index.d.ts
- so we don't need to install types for it
